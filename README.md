# Brain Stroke Detection Using Basic Machine Models

<p> by Lawrence Menegus </p>

### Project Objective
<p> The primary objective of this Jupyter Notebook is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of two datasets related to brain strokes. The focus will be on leveraging various machine learning techniques to identify and predict factors contributing to the occurrence of a brain stroke. This phase will involve extensive data exploration, cleaning, and preprocessing, followed by the application of predictive modeling to ascertain the key determinants of stroke. </p>

### Data Processing
<p> Cleaning and Preprocessing: 
The datasets were processed to resize, convert to RGB, and normalize the images before feeding them into the models.</p>

### Dataset Splitting
<p> The data was split into training and testing sets using a 90-10 ratio </p>

### Visualization 
<p>Using seaborn, matplotlib and other libraries to create plots and graphs to display visual graphics of the data in a easy to view manor</p>
